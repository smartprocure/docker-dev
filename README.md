# docker-dev
Dockerized Development Environment

Quick Start
------------
- Run `docker-compose up`
- Open the following url http://localhost:8181
- In a Cloud9 IDE terminal tab run `bash /workspace/transfer/setup.sh`

Prerequisites and Assumptions
-----------------------------
- Install [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac) (or windows if you're into that sort thing)
- This assumes a *nix like environment, meaning you need:
    - SSH set up on your host at `~/.ssh` with a `id_rsa` that is not password protected (for now)
    - A `.gitconfig` in `~/.gitconfig`
- *NOTE* This currently assumes you pull this down into `./dev`.

Services
--------
This will set up a full development environment in docker with the following services:

- Cloud9 IDE (localhost:8181)
- Ungit Git Client (localhost:8448)
- MongoDB
- Redis
- RabbitMQ
- Elasticsearch

Good-to-Know Docker Compose Commands
------------------------------------
- docker-compose up: Start all the services in the docker-compose environment (create if it doesn't exist).
- docker-compose stop: Stop all the services in the docker-compose environment
- docker-compose down: Stop and *remove* all the services (this will wipe the data too)

Some Cloud9 Tips
----------------
- Open a new terminal with `alt-t`
- Run `npm i -g c9` to be able to open files in Cloud9 from a terminal with `c9 FILENAME` (our main application repo will do this for you)
